 The Schrodinger equation
In this section we’ll give a “derivation” of the Schrodinger equation. Our starting point will
be the classical nonrelativistic expression for the energy of a particle, which is the sum of
the kinetic and potential energies. We’ll assume as usual that the potential is a function of
only x. We have
E = K + V =
1
2
mv2 + V (x) = p
2
2m
+ V (x). (3)
We’ll now invoke de Broglie’s claim that all particles can be represented as waves with
frequency ω and wavenumber k, and that E = ¯hω and p = ¯hk. This turns the expression
for the energy into
¯hω =
¯h
2
k
2
2m
+ V (x). (4)
A wave with frequency ω and wavenumber k can be written as usual as ψ(x, t) = Aei(kx−ωt)
(the convention is to put a minus sign in front of the ωt). In 3-D we would have ψ(r, t) =
Aei(k·r−ωt)
, but let’s just deal with 1-D. We now note that
∂ψ
∂t = −iωψ =⇒ ωψ = i

∂t , and
∂

= −k
2ψ =⇒ k
2ψ = −

. (5)
If we multiply the energy equation in Eq. (4) by ψ, and then plug in these relations, we
obtain
¯h(ωψ) = ¯h

This is the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. If we put the x and t arguments back in,
the equation takes the form,

In 3-D, the x dependence turns into dependence on all three coordinates (x, y, z), and the
∂
2ψ/∂x2
term becomes ∇2ψ (the sum of the second derivatives). Remember that Born’s
(correct) interpretation of ψ(x) is that |ψ(x)|
2 gives the probability of finding the particle
at position x.
Having successfully produced the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we should ask:
Did the above reasoning actually prove that the Schrodinger equation is valid? No, it didn’t,
for three reasons.
1. The reasoning is based on de Broglie’s assumption that there is a wave associated with
every particle, and also on the assumption that the ω and k of the wave are related to
E and p via Planck’s constant in Eqs. (1) and (2). We had to accept these assumptions
on faith.
2. Said in a different way, it is impossible to actually prove anything in physics. All we
can do is make an educated guess at a theory, and then do experiments to try to show
10.2. THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION 5
that the theory is consistent with the real world. The more experiments we do, the
more comfortable we are that the theory is a good one. But we can never be absolutely
sure that we have the correct theory. In fact, odds are that it’s simply the limiting
case of a more correct theory.
3. The Schrodinger equation actually isn’t valid, so there’s certainly no way that we
proved it. Consistent with the above point concerning limiting cases, the quantum
theory based on Schrodinger’s equation is just a limiting theory of a more correct one,
which happens to be quantum field theory (which unifies quantum mechanics with
special relativity). This is turn must be a limiting theory of yet another more correct
one, because it doesn’t incorporate gravity. Eventually there will be one theory that
covers everything (although this point can be debated), but we’re definitely not there
yet.
Due to the “i” that appears in Eq. (6), ψ(x) is complex. And in contrast with waves in
classical mechanics, the entire complex function now matters in quantum mechanics. We
won’t be taking the real part in the end. Up to this point in the book, the use of complex
functions was simply a matter of convenience, because it is easier to work with exponentials
than trig functions. Only the real part mattered (or imaginary part – take your pick, but not
both). But in quantum mechanics the whole complex wavefunction is relevant. However,
the theory is structured in such a way that anything you might want to measure (position,
momentum, energy, etc.) will always turn out to be a real quantity. This is a necessary
feature of any valid theory, of course, because you’re not going to go out and measure a
distance of 2 + 5i meters, or pay an electrical bill of 17 + 6i kilowatt hours.
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, there is an endless number of difficult
questions about quantum mechanics that can be discussed. But in this short introduction
to the subject, let’s just accept Schrodinger’s equation as valid, and see where it takes us.

Solving the equation
If we put aside the profound implications of the Schrodinger equation and regard it as
simply a mathematical equation, then it’s just another wave equation. We already know
the solution, of course, because we used the function ψ(x, t) = Aei(kx−ωt)
to produce Eqs.
(5) and (6) in the first place. But let’s pretend that we don’t know this, and let’s solve the
Schrodinger equation as if we were given it out of the blue.
As always, we’ll guess an exponential solution. If we first look at exponential behavior
in the time coordinate, our guess is ψ(x, t) = e
−iωtf(x) (the minus sign here is convention).
Plugging this into Eq. (7) and canceling the e
−iωt yields
¯hωf(x) = −
¯h

2m
∂
2f(x)
∂x2
+ V (x)f(x). (8)
But from Eq. (1), we have ¯hω = E. And we’ll now replace f(x) with ψ(x). This might
cause a little confusion, since we’ve already used ψ to denote the entire wavefunction ψ(x, t).
However, it is general convention to also use the letter ψ to denote the spatial part. So we
now have
E ψ(x) = −
¯h

∂
2ψ(x)
∂x2
+ V (x)ψ(x) (9)
This is called the time-independent Schrodinger equation. This equation is more restrictive
than the original time-dependent Schrodinger equation, because it assumes that the particle/wave has a definite energy (that is, a definite ω). In general, a particle can be in a state
that is the superposition of states with various definite energies, just like the motion of a
6 CHAPTER 10. INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS
string can be the superposition of various normal modes with definite ω’s. The same reasoning applies here as with all the other waves we’ve discussed: From Fourier analysis and
from the linearity of the Schrodinger equation, we can build up any general wavefunction
from ones with specific energies. Because of this, it suffices to consider the time-independent
Schrodinger equation. The solutions for that equation form a basis for all possible solutions.1
Continuing with our standard strategy of guessing exponentials, we’ll let ψ(x) = Aeikx
.
Plugging this into Eq. (9) and canceling the e
ikx gives (going back to the ¯hω instead of E)
¯hω = −

+ V (x). (10)
This is simply Eq. (4), so we’ve ended up back where we started, as expected. However, our
goal here was to show how the Schrodinger equation can be solved from scratch, without
knowing where it came from.
Eq. (10) is (sort of) a dispersion relation. If V (x) is a constant C in a given region, then
the relation between ω and k (namely ω = ¯hk2/2m + C) is independent of x, so we have
a nice sinusoidal wavefunction (or exponential, if k is imaginary). However, if V (x) isn’t
constant, then the wavefunction isn’t characterized by a unique wavenumber. So a function
of the form e
ikx doesn’t work as a solution for ψ(x). (A Fourier superposition can certainly
work, since any function can be expressed that way, but a single e
ikx by itself doesn’t work.)
This is similar to the case where the density of a string isn’t constant. We don’t obtain
sinusoidal waves there eithe
